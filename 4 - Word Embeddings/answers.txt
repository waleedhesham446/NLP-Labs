Q1:

Number of words in the dataset (vocabulary size)


Q2:

The dimensionality of each vector representing word embedding 


Predicted Country:
Egypt

Predicted Similarity:
0.7626820802688599

Q3:

Yes


Q4:

Yes, because the relationship between `Athens` and `Greece` (capital city of the country) is the same relation
between `Cairo` and `Egypt`. The similarity printed above is the similarity between relationships
`CAPITAL(Athens, Greece)` and `CAPITAL(Cairo, Egypt)` and it approaches 1 which makes sense. 


Computed Accuracy:
0.9192082407594425

Q5:

Yes, except the word `sad`. It is very close to words of opposite meaning like `joyful` and `happy`.
However, it may be considered make sense as the words `sad`, `joyful` and `happy` share the similarity of human feelings.
In addition, the plot is applied after PCA and this is a another cause for the `sad` being close to `joyful` and `happy`.
Other than this, other similar words tends to be close in the plot.


Q6:

Similar words have similar embeddings which implies being close to each other in the plot.
Words like `gas`, `oil` and `petroleum` are similar and they are very close in the plot.
Same thing for `country` and `continent`. And for `city`, `town` and `village`.
Also similar clusters are close to each other. The `country`, `continent` cluster are similar to the `city`, `town`, `village`
and that's why the 2 clusters are close to each other. The human feeling words like `sad`, `joyful`, `happy` are close to each other.
Another notice is that different clusters tends to be far away from each others.
